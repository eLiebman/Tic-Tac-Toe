# Tic-Tac-Toe

For this project, I used object constructors to generate a tic-tac-toe board.
Each box is an object, and the board object contains an array of nine boxes.
The board has methods for filling boxes, checking for a winner, and can test possible moves to chose the best one.
Most of the CSS and HTML was provided by TeamTreeHouse for this project. All Javascript was written by me.

Play the game!
